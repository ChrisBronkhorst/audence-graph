; Implement graph distance metrics: eccentricity, radius, diameter

(comment
  (let [G1 (-> (empty-graph)
               (add-edge :top-left :top-right 1)
               (add-edge :top-left :bottom-left 1)

     (algo/radius G1)
     (algo/diameter G1)]))

; Further thinking, from wikipedia:
; In the case of a directed graph the distance d(u,v)
; between two vertices u and v is defined as the length of
; a shortest directed path from u to v consisting of arcs,
; provided at least one such path exists.[3] Notice that,
; in contrast with the case of undirected graphs, d(u,v) does not necessarily
; coincide with d(v,u)â€”so it is just a quasi-metric, and it might be the
; case that one is defined while the other is not.

; Note from Chris
; Notice, since eccentricity is a "quasi-metric" on directed graphs,
; We are not always guaranteed to have a radius, diameter of a directed graph.
; Even in the case where the graph is connected, we can always have nodes which
; do not have outgoing connections, even if they are fully reachable from other nodes
; and we do not have any partitions in the graph, as in the example of the square graph above.
; The only node that can reach all of the other nodes is the top-left node.
; If we connect the :outside node to the :top-right node, we will have a radius and diameter.

; now we see that all of our metrics work, but :top-left has short paths,
; and the other paths need to loop through the :outside node.
